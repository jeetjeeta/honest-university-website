	       	<p>Welcome to our lovely university. If you are<span> single</span> then join our university without any second thought</p>
	       	<p>Now single students dont have to worry about sex because we will<span> fuck you</span> daily.</p>
	       	<p>When you are busy in completing our assignment you will forget what sex is because free time is not provided even for <span> masturbation </span>.</p>
	       	<p>And even then if you have some free time left then let us introduce to our attendance. We will make sure you get <span> debarred </span> by marking you absent for even a small mistake</p>
	       	<br/>
	       	<p>So let's go to admission section and submit the fees and if u think you will change your mind later then dont worry we wont<span> return your fees</span> too so that you
	       	 cannot leave. This is to prevent you from destroying your career.</p>
